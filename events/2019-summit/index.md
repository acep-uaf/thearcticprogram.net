title: 2019 Alaska Summit for Place-Based Resilience
---

From 4-6 September, representatives from the Department of Energy, Department of Defense,
Office of Naval Research, Alaskan startups, Alaskan research entities, and Alaskan communities
convened to discuss overlapping priorities between these stakeholder groups. The goal was to
surface shared problems in order to align interests, pool resources, and minimize duplication of
efforts


## PRIORITIZED PROBLEMS
* Alaska's transportation infrastructure, including ports, rail, roads, and facilities, require
improvements in resilience, redundancy and capacity to support growth.
* Alaska communities - including military sites - need modular, mobile, energy-efficient,
durable, healthy, cost-effective housing solutions in order to sustain livelihoods and
operations in changing conditions.
*  Renewable technologies need models to predict provided inertia to grid systems in order to
reduce the impact of disturbances on the grid _(e.g. loss of generation, loss of load)._

## KEY TAKEAWAYS
* Several organizations have their own individual "innovation pipelines" breaking down the
steps needed to transition from a problem to a pilot and eventually scale.
** The value in these collaborative sessions is forming connections with other
organizations that have expertise or resources in specific parts of the pipeline.
* Scaling from a prototype to a permanent solution is a challenge across the board in both
local communities and Department of Defense programs.
* Follow ups from local Alaskans do not necessarily have to manifest in demonstration-ready
prototypes; collected data and well-crafted presentations are much more agile methods to
inject locally incubated solutions into DoD challenges.
* Cross-pollinating between all of the stakeholder groups present (DoD, AK startup
community, AK universities, and Fairbanks local leadership) was critical to establishing
crucial stakeholders and shared problem sets

## NEXT STEPS
Further engagement in local Alaska Events, [calendar linked
here](https://www.startupdigest.com/digests/alaska)
* [Accelerate Alaska Meeting](https://www.accelerateak.com) - discussion forum for private investors on Alaska projects and efforts - 19-20 September in Anchorage, AK
* Planning Conference for Arctic Edge, a joint readiness exercise - 3rd December at
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson
* [Alaska Defense Forum](https://adcregionalforum.org/alaska/) - meeting to form linkages between local and state resources with DoD focuses - [3-4 October in Fairbanks, AK](https://www.fairbankschamber.org/events/details/alaska-defense-forum-25758)
